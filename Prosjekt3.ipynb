The particles' movement is mostly determined by diffusion and the electric force due to the voltage over the membrane, but sometimes the membrane potential refrain the particles from moving to the other side of the membrane. Since the membran potential does not stop all the particles from moving through the membrane and the particles all have the same electric charge, the number of particles at each side of the membrane will even out until the electric force and diffusion gradient both equal zero. Hence, the voltage will settle at zero over time. \n",

    "There is 29 times more sodium particles and 28 times less potassium particles outside than inside the cell membrane. Very few of the potassium particles will move through the membrane because the membrane potential for potassium is so high that it acts as barrier counteracting both the diffusion gradient and electrical force (in the beginning these are opposite for potassium). Sodium particles will move through the membrane and into the cell due to diffusion and the electric force generated by the voltage over the cell membrane. \n",
    "\n",
    "After 50 sodium particles have crossed the membrane, there is an equal amount of charge inside and outside of the membrane and the voltage is 0. However, there are still more sodium particles outside than inside and they will continue to move through the membrane because of the diffusion gradient. As the potassium ions are essentially trapped, diffusion of sodium from the outside in is the only diffusion that takes place. That is why the voltage does not settle at 0 as it did in exercise 7.1. As more sodium particles cross the membrane, the voltage increases and generates an electric force that points in the opposite direction of the diffusion gradient. To begin with, the force due to the voltage is not strong enough to cancel out the diffusion force on the sodium particle. Therefore, the voltage increases and it settles when the diffusion force and electric force are equally strong. According to the plot, the forces are equally strong when the normalized voltage reaches 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last plot shows how the voltage changes as a function of time when $\\beta V_{Na}^{0} = 10$ and $\\beta V_{K}^{0} = 1$. This situation is qualitatively different. This time, the membrane potential is very high for the sodium particles, effectively trapping the sodium particles outside the cell in the same way the potassium particles were trapped inside in the first case. The potassium particles, however, can now easily cross the barrier to the outside of the cell. In the first situation, both the diffusion gradient and the electric force are in favour of the sodium particles crossing the barrier. However, in this situation the diffusion gradient and the electric force have opposite effects on the potassium, respectively pushing it out of the cell because the concentration of potassium is much lower there and pushing it from the outside and in as the potential is lower there. In the beginning, the effect of the electric force is largest so that some particles will cross the membrane from the outside and in until the diffusion gradient and the electric force balances each other at a normalized voltage equaling about -1.9. However, the total forces are smaller, making the process slower and more subject to the effects of random walk than in the first situation. This is reflected in the plot, where the variation of the voltage is greater and the voltage stabilises slower than in the plot depicting the first situation. "

    "Initially, there is 50 sodium ions and 1400 potassium ions inside (in total 1450 particles). The outside of the membrane will constantly have a concentration corresponding to 1500 particles in the simulation, 1450 sodium and 50 potassium. In other words there is an abundance of sodium particles on the outside and potassium particles on the inside. When the gates are closed, represented by setting $V_{Na}(x) = V_{K}(x) = 50$ in the membrane, the membrane is practically impenetrable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the initial difference of concentration of positively charged ions, $V(t) \\leq -70$ mV so that the sodium is opened (by setting $V_{na} = 1$). Thus, the sodium ions will rush in due to the gradient of charge and concentration, until $V(t) \\geq 30$ mV. Note that the dimensionless equivalent to $V(t) = -70$ mV in our plot is the value -2.6, and $V(t) = 30$ mV equals 1.12. Typically, around 60 or 70 sodium ions will pass the membrane at this stage, so that the total of ions inside increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the sodium gate closes (by setting $V_{na} = 50$) and the potassium gate opens ($V_{K} = 1$). Now, due to the difference in consentration and total charge, the potassium ions wil rush in until $V(t) \\leq -70$ mV. As one can see from the plot, the plot will try to stabilize between -1.0 (26.8 mV) and -1.5 (-40.1 mV) at this point due to the same reasons the potassium plot in 7.2 equalized around -1.9. Here, however, the value is higher because there is a higher concentration of sodium ions inside of the membrane than in 7.2. Due to the potassium gate still being open at this point, the only way for the cycle to repeat is for the random walk of sodium ions to cause a voltage difference larger than -70 mV. The more sodium ions there is on the inside, the less chance there is of enough potassium ions wandering across the membrane. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the cycle will repeat 1 or 2 times before stopping completely, in rare cases 3. The potential difference will stabilize on higher and higher values after each cycle, making it less likely for enough potassium ions to cross the membrane such that the cycle may repeat. The reason why the number varies is due to the randomness of the diffusion, as the number of sodium and potassium particles that cross the membrane during the cycle varies from time to time."
